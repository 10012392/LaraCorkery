## Breif 
Black Chilli Designs is a local business in Tauranga and is my client for this assignment. The business design custom manufacturing and event hire company. The purpose of Black Chilli Design website is to bring customers to the business by showing previous projects that the company has taken part in, but also show just some of what Black Chilli Designs is capable of. Key requirements for the website is to ensure the content being advertised is clear and easy to see. The key message of the website is for customers to get in contact about design, manufacturing and hiring products as every project is different.

## Research

* __Key items to include in the site__
* __Special Requirements the client wants__ 
* __Current web design trends that can be applied to the site__

### Similar Websites 
__Research Results__ 
While looking at similar business websites, I saw a common trend, the simplisity of the layout. Everything is clearly layed out and easy to navigate through both websites. As a result, for the website I will keep the layout clear and more simple, as to keep the navigation of the website easy to use for customers.

## Three High Fidelity Wireframes 
Based on findings of your research you are to produce three high fidelity wireframes from which your client will select one for the site. The wireframes should give an idea of layout, navigation, colours, font types and sizes and types and sized images used.

![Second High Fidelity Wireframe](HomePage2.PNG)
![Third High Fidelity Wireframe](Homepage3.PNG)

From these high fidelity wireframes I decided to go with the layout and theme of second high fidelity wireframe as the layout works and its simple. 

Based on the second high fidelity wireframe is how the website is going to look through all the pages holding that same type of theme.
