The purpose of Black Chilli Design website is to bring customers to the business by showing previous projects that the company has taken part in, but also show just some of what Black Chilli Designs is capable of.

### Similar Websites 
__Research Results__ 
While looking at similar business websites, I saw a common trend, the simplisity of the layout. Everything is clearly layed out and easy to navigate through both websites. As a result, for the website I will keep the layout clear and more simple, as to keep the navigation of the website easy to use for customers.
